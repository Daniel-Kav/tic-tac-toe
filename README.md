a simple implementation of a tic tac toe game done in 
plain javascriptJavaScript code for a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using the module pattern. The code contains three main modules: displayController, gameboard, and Game. It also includes helper functions checkForWin and checkForTie to determine game outcomes. Finally, it sets up event listeners for the "Restart" and "Start" buttons.
displayController: Handles rendering messages on the web page.

Provides a function renderMessage to update the message displayed on the web page.
gameboard: Manages the game board and rendering.

Maintains an array representing the game board.
Provides functions render, update, and getgameboard to manage the rendering and updates of the game board.
createPlayer: A factory function to create player objects with a name and mark.

Game: The core game logic.

Manages players and their turns.
Handles click events on the game board.
Checks for win and tie conditions.
Provides functions start, restart, and handleClick.
checkForWin: Helper function to determine if a player has won the game.

checkForTie: Helper function to determine if the game has ended in a tie.

Overall, the code seems well-structured and follows good programming practices. However, I would recommend adding comments to the code to make it more understandable, especially for people who are not familiar with the code or the game's rules. Comments can help explain the purpose and functionality of different parts of the code.
